# CS 248A Assignments Repository

This repository contains the code and resources for the Stanford CS 248A assignments. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment.

## Getting Started

Follow the [installation instructions](docs/installation.md) to set up the project.  Even if you don't have time to begin work on the assignment immediately, we __strongly recommend__ that students take a moment to following these installation instructions to make sure you can run the starter code on the machine you will be working on.  (We have tested the assignment code base on OSX, Windows, and Linux.)

This repository comes with a interactive renderer, please follow the [interactive renderer guide](docs/interactive-renderer.md) to learn how to use it. Of course, until you implement parts of the assignments, when you press the render button in the interactive viewer you aren't going to see much!
